# ES-LTR-Implicit-Explicit-Correlation
Correlation of Implicit feedback (click-through data) versus Explicit Human Relevance Judgements for Learning to Rank (LTR)

This script correlates the ranking performance of a ’real world’ Enterprise Search (ES) service of a large organisation using both relevance judgements and
click-through data (CTR). 


The click-through rate (CTR) is generally defined as the percentage of the number of clicks to the number of impressions~\cite{Chapelle2011}.  

For the purposes of this study, we calculate the CTR as a ratio showing how often people who see the document,d, in the returned listing actually generated by query,q, end up clicking it.
 
 \[ CTR_{(q,d)} = \frac{ clicks_{(q,d)}}{impressions_{(q,d)}} \]
 
 where impressions is the sum of clicks for all documents returned for q.  A high CTR is a good indication that users find the document within the listings as helpful and relevant for the given query.


We generate and publish a small manually annotated LTR dataset (ENTRP-SRCH.txt) and calculate a Spearman correlation coefficient.


The attached dataset and code were used to perform correlation and ranking performance tests.

The LTR dataset is formatted as follows: -

To reproduce, simply download the code (python ipynb file) and dataset (txt file).  It was compliled using python 3 and requires the installation (pip3) of datapane,jinja2 and scipy packages.
